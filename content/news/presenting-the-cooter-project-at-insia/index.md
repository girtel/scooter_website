José Santa presents the SCOOTER project at the intelligent vehicles workshop “Innovations for more intelligent, connected and autonomous vehicles” in frames of the the ITS network RETEVI-II.

This R&D network involves nationwide ITS groups and it is financed by the spanish MINECO (Ministry of Economy, Competitivity and Universities).

We had a very interesting exchange of ideas and research topics on the ITS field at the conference.
