abstract: Remote vehicle monitoring is a field that has recently attracted the attention
  of both academia and industry. With the dawn of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm,
  the possibilities for performing this task have multiplied, due to the emergence
  of low-cost and multi-purpose monitoring devices and the evolution of wireless transmission
  technologies. Low Power-Wide Area Network (LPWAN) encompasses a set of IoT communication
  technologies that are gaining momentum, due to their highly valued features regarding
  transmission distance and end-device energy consumption. For that reason, in this
  work we present a vehicular monitoring platform enabled by LPWAN-based technology,
  namely Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). Concretely, we explore the end-to-end
  architecture considering vehicle data retrieving by using an On-Board Diagnostics
  II (OBD-II) interface, their compression with a novel IETF compression scheme in
  order to transmit them over the constrained LoRaWAN link, and information visualization
  through a data server hosted in the cloud, by means of a web-based dashboard. A
  key advance of the proposal is the design and development of a UNIX-based network
  interface for LPWAN communications. The whole system has been tested in a university
  campus environment, showing its capabilities to remotely track vehicle status in
  real-time. The conducted performance evaluation also shows high levels of reliability
  in the transmission link, with packet delivery ratios over 95%. The platform boosts
  the process of monitoring vehicles, enabling a variety of services such as mechanical
  failure prediction and detection, fleet management, and traffic monitoring, and
  is extensible to light vehicles with severe power constraints.
