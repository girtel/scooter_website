 abstract = {Remote vehicle monitoring is a field that has recently attracted the attention of both academia and industry. With the dawn of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, the possibilities for performing this task have multiplied, due to the emergence of low-cost and multi-purpose monitoring devices and the evolution of wireless transmission technologies. Low Power-Wide Area Network (LPWAN) encompasses a set of IoT communication technologies that are gaining momentum, due to their highly valued features regarding transmission distance and end-device energy consumption. For that reason, in this work we present a vehicular monitoring platform enabled by LPWAN-based technology, namely Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). Concretely, we explore the end-to-end architecture considering vehicle data retrieving by using an On-Board Diagnostics II (OBD-II) interface, their compression with a novel IETF compression scheme in order to transmit them over the constrained LoRaWAN link, and information visualization through a data server hosted in the cloud, by means of a web-based dashboard. A key advance of the proposal is the design and development of a UNIX-based network interface for LPWAN communications. The whole system has been tested in a university campus environment, showing its capabilities to remotely track vehicle status in real-time. The conducted performance evaluation also shows high levels of reliability in the transmission link, with packet delivery ratios over 95%. The platform boosts the process of monitoring vehicles, enabling a variety of services such as mechanical failure prediction and detection, fleet management, and traffic monitoring, and is extensible to light vehicles with severe power constraints.},
