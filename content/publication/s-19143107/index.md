abstract: Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a hot research niche exploiting the synergy
  between Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) and the Internet
  of Things (IoT), which can greatly benefit of the upcoming development of 5G technologies.
  The variety of end-devices, applications, and Radio Access Technologies (RATs) in
  IoV calls for new networking schemes that assure the Quality of Service (QoS) demanded
  by the users. To this end, network slicing techniques enable traffic differentiation
  with the aim of ensuring flow isolation, resource assignment, and network scalability.
  This work fills the gap of 5G network slicing for IoV and validates it in a realistic
  vehicular scenario. It offers an accurate bandwidth control with a full flow-isolation,
  which is essential for vehicular critical systems. The development is based on a
  distributed Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) architecture, which provides flexibility
  for the dynamic placement of the Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) in charge
  of managing network traffic. The solution is able to integrate heterogeneous radio
  technologies such as cellular networks and specific IoT communications with potential
  in the vehicular sector, creating isolated network slices without risking the Core
  Network (CN) scalability. The validation results demonstrate the framework capabilities
  of short and predictable slice-creation time, performance/QoS assurance and service
  scalability of up to one million connected devices.
