abstract: Virtualization technologies are key enablers of softwarized 5G networks,
  and their usage in the vehicular domain can provide flexibility and reliability
  in real deployments, where mobility and processing needs may be an issue. Next-generation
  vehicular services, such as the ones in the area of urban mobility and, in general,
  those interconnecting on-board sensors, require continuous data gathering and processing,
  but current architectures are stratified in two-tier solutions in which data is
  collected by on-board units (OBU) and sent to cloud servers. In this line, intermediate
  cache and processing layers are needed in order to cover quasi-ubiquitous data-gathering
  needs of vehicles in scenarios of smart cities/roads considering vehicles as moving
  sensors. The SURROGATES solution presented in this paper proposes to virtualize
  vehicle OBUs and create a novel Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) layer with the
  aim of offloading processing from the vehicle and serving data-access requests.
  This deals with potential disconnection periods of vehicles, saves radio resources
  when accessing the physical OBU and improves data processing performance. A proof
  of concept has been implemented using OpenStack and Open Source MANO to virtualize
  resources and gather data from in-vehicle sensors, and a final traffic monitoring
  service has been implemented to validate the proposal. Performance results reveal
  a speedup of more than 50% in the data request resolution, with consequently great
  savings of network resources in the wireless segment. Thus, this work opens a novel
  path regarding the virtualization of end-devices in the Intelligent Transportation
  Systems (ITS) ecosystem.
